# Blender SysDolphin Addon

A Blender addon for importing gamecube .dat models into Blender. This addon is currently developed predominantly for `Pokemon Colosseum` and `Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness` but may have some compatibility with other games that use the format (based on the sysdolphin library) such as `Super Smash Bros. Melee`, `Kirby Air ride`, `Killer7`, `Chibi Robo Unpluged`.

Original implementation provided by Made and StarsMmd.
