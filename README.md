A Blender addon for importing gamecube .dat models into blender. This addon is currently developed predominantly for Pokemon Colosseum and Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness but may have some compatibility with other games that use the format such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air ride.
Original implementation provided by Made.
